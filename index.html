          <p>Every man has a dream: to create. For some, that is creating problems. For others, creating art. Some yet, creation includes a good time. But for me, I chose to create a story.</p>
          <p>
            Let me take you on a journey. I will showcase a few bosses that you can select via the Dropdown menu. Each of these are terminal bosses or concepts to each arc of the story. Go ahead and click on one of the menu options to get started

            As a prison, the Terrarium is designed around Newton's 3th law of Physics (for each action is an opposite and equal reaction). To keep what it contains, contained, it must provide an equal force that ensures it cannot leave; to ensure this, it creates entities that may resemble familiar gods. Think of the entities created inside as gatekeepers; when they are defeated, that power is shifted elsewhere. The idea is if anyone were to come in as an executioner, they could garner enough power and execute whatever is contained therein. The final failsafe being the Loop, which resets power back to as it was (which is done at great strain; moving against time is arduous and costly)
          </p>
          <p>
            The issue is thus; one day the Terrarium cracks, and that crack happened to be the Loop's integral systems. This iteration is the last, and the issue is that the sacrifices Corvex (Owner of Corvex Incorporated, and an ancient human who has long ago descended into near-madness) sends in have been missing and have raised suspicion. He can't take anyone who is well known, so he grabs the poor child of two of his workers (who have shown promise but also not enough to be exceptional, but who are also eager to please) and throws him in. Our Protagonist (the sacrifice)'s parents sell their son as some kind of hero, and since Corvex is human (and an ancient one who is barely holding his sanity together), he is manipulated and gaslit into thinking they're right.

          <img src="Anahita_(minion).gif" alt="moving gif of Kehlani" class="gif">
          <p>Kehlani is one of the few remaining water folk. Aquian tribes lived peacefully under the water before a creature shaped like a man but with grey limbs the color of rock and glowing eyes used some machine on them. They tried to fight back, but strange liquids mixed with their waters and killed most of them off. Their lands were demolished, and few escaped. Kehlani was one of the lucky few, as a young girl she escaped. However, instead of swimming to the surface, Kehlani swum deeper, until the light from the surface and the coral lamps were gone. In the pitch black, a giant sea serpent offered safety, bemoaning hunger and a loss of home. Kehlani, as a kind-hearted girl, offered to help the sea serpent find food. The sea serpent took her to a rock near a beach, asking her to lure these evil land-people. So Kehlani would lure pirates, at first trying to offer food, before discovering that these pirates were...lonely. Eventually, any sailor or fisherman who would hear her enchanting song and see her visage would jump into the hidden jaws of the Leviathan. This worked for quite a long time; Kehlani was protected, for anyone who would come near her would be consumed, and the Leviathan would get food. But mankind (for the Aquians are still a relative of the human race) are social creatures, and isolation from others of her kind caused her to struggle. Some days, she would lay motionless on her rock, unable to motivate herself to sing. Ironically, this was a stronger pull than her allure or her song, as many an opportune and lonely fisherman would attempt to "introduce" themselves. This loneliness continued to gnaw at Kehlani, making her question if she was getting the short end of the stick in the bargain.</p>
          <p>
            Upon saying she wanted to go for a swim, the Leviathan would "go check" for potential dangers, only to return with horrors of the metal man and his oceanic destruction. "It's not safe for one of your kind to swim without protection," he would whisper, "and I need some more sustenance to be strong enough to protect you." Subtle manipulation keeps Kehlani wanting but scared

          </div>
          <p>A Goddess, radiant in glory, but unable to escape such a confinement as Aergon's first project. The Terrarium is too strong of an opponent, but only for now. She sent her prophets to gather together devotees, priests, and even captured prisoners. For in order for her to obtain true Godhood, she must first consume that which the Traitor adores; the flesh of his own kin. First dozens, then hundreds. Every week more people are burnt into the essence of Paritas, and each day she grows stronger. It will not be long before she can break this enclosure; and soon enough she can even consume that pesky cyborg himself for putting everyone into this mess. Once Paritas slays the Gods present in the Terrarium, then only Heaven is left to conquer. Nothing can stop the Light of Almighty Paritas.

        <p>Want to know where the idea where this story came from? A game called Terraria; specifically, the Calamity Mod for Terraria. The link for Terraria can be found <a class="credit-links" title="Goated game!" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/">Here</a>, and the link for the mod itself can be found <a class="credit-links" title="TModLoader is also free on Steam!" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824688072"> here.</a></p>

            Credit should also go to my mother, for listening to me rant incoherently for hours on end and who eventually suggested I make the website about this book I'm writing. Kudos to you, mom! Love you bunches!
